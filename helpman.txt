MiniWeb Manual
==============

MiniWeb is a very simple Web Browser with support for varying user agent strings.

MiniWeb's purpose is for testing website layouts for different screen sizes and
different user agents (browser/device combinations), in particular for
different phones. It allows switching user agents on the fly.

It uses an extensible configuration file, with builtin default examples, which
sets user agent strings and screen sizes to simulate different phones.

MiniWeb can also be handy to watch small websites when doing other work, such as
news tickers, sports scores, weather reports and such things. It provides an
automatic reload timer for keeping these things current.

== Language and Keyboards

The language and keyboard references in this manual are for English in North America,
and similar keyboard layouts. In some locales the keys will have different labels. If
you manage to run this on a phone with only a numeric keypad, the shortcuts may
not work. 

== Buttons

There is one button. It is small and flat in the top left hand corner of the window. It
does not have a label. Clicking on the button opens the *Main Window*.

== Menus

There are two menus. The *Main Menu* and the *Settings Menu*. You can
reach the *Main Menu* by clicking the button, or by the *Ctrl-M* shortcut.
You can reach the *Settings Menu* from the *Main Menu*, or by the *Ctrl-S* shortcut.

=== Main Menu

The *Main Menu* allows you to access all functions of the program. You can select from
these entries:

- *Quit* exits the program
- *Cancel* closes the menu and does nothing
- *Open...* allows you to open a web page, after entering the page using a dialog
- *Settings...* gets you to the *Settings Menu*
- *Help...* opens the help manual (the one you are reading now) in the browser
- *License...* shows the license in the browser

=== Settings Menu

The *Settings Menu* allows you to change some of the functionality and
looks of the browser. You can select from these entries:

- *Reload Timer* allows you to adjust the delay of the reload timer, or to
turn off the timer by setting the delay to zero (0). 
- *Frame On/Off* switches the window frame on or off. This feature may not work on
some versions of Windows. This feature may not make sense if you run this
program on a phone.
- *Portrait / Landscape* changes the orientation of the browser, by switching
the length of the vertical and horizontal sides
- *User Agent* allows you to change the user agent. You can select a different agent,
or the one presently used, from a list of kown agents. This list can be customized
by editing the *Agent List File*.
- *Cancel* closes the menu and does nothing

== Shortcut Keys

MiniWeb provides shortcut keys to make operation easier, and largely independent
or mouse or other pointing devices. This can be very useful for some environments. Note
however that all these functions are accessible from the menus, and by mouse or other 
pointing device.

 - *Escape* usually the same as *Cancel* in menus
 - *Ctrl-B* go back one page in the browser
 - *Ctrl-F* go forward one page in the browser
 - *Ctrl-H* open the Help manual
 - *Ctrl-M* open the *Main Menu*
 - *Ctrl-L* open a new web link
 - *Ctrl-O* open a new web link
 - *Ctrl-Q* exit the program, same as *Quit* from the *Main Menu*
 - *Ctrl-R* reload the current page
 - *Ctrl-S* open the *Settings Menu*
 - *Ctrl-W* toggle the window frame on/off, same as *Frame On/Off* from
 the *Settings Menu*

== Agent List File

MiniWeb contains a built-in list of user agents. It will also read 
a list from a file in a standard location, if that file exists. Normally
the file is called ".miniweb_agents.xml" in the user's home directory. The
file name and location can be changed by editing the file ".miniweb_cfg.xml"
in the user's home directory.

The agent list is in a custom XML format, that looks like this:

.Agent File Example
[source,xml]
----
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='utf-8'?>
<useragentfile version="1.0" >
 <Agent name="Max" >
  <useragentstring>Maxwell Smart</useragentstring>
  <size high="600" wide="800" />
 </Agent>
</useragentfile>
----

The *useragentstring* entry is what is presented to the website. Copy this
from your favourit browser.

=== Finding User Agent Strings

Many user agent strings can be found on the web of course. If you want to find
out the string from a particular phone, make a web page like this

.Web Page to Find User Agent Strings
[source,html]
----
<html>
<head> </head>
<body>
<?php phpinfo(); ?>
</body>
</html>
----
and see what it says in the Apache Environment under HTTP_USER_AGENT when you
surf to that page from the phone.

== Emulating Phone Browsers

MiniWeb _does not emulate any phone browsers_. It uses the standard browser
provided by the Qt WebKit framework. The only aspects of phone browsers, or
of any other user agents, are the user agent string presented to the website,
and the screen size provided. Consequently there is no guarantee that what
you see on MiniWeb looks anything like what you see on a phone, even if you
use the identical user agent string and screen size.

== Building MiniWeb from Source

MiniWeb can be built from the command line in Linux, or from the Qt Creator tool
in Windows. It can probably be build quite easily on Mac OS-X as well, or on
anything else that is compatible with Qt 4x. Try it for your favourite phone,
it will probably work.

=== Prerequisits

To build and run MiniWeb, the current version uses:

. C++
.. Gcc or Visual C++
. Qt4, including these parts:
.. Core
.. Gui
.. Network
.. Xml
.. WebKit

=== How to Build

It's pretty straightforward. Please read the INSTALL file that comes with
the source code.
