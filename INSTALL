Building from Source Code
=========================

This program requires the Qt4 toolset. If you don't have Qt, you can 
get it from 

     http://qt.nokia.com
     
Qt4 is available for many platforms. This program has been built on Linux/X11
and on Windows 32 bit.

Building
--------

There should be a file named "build.sh". This is a shell script that tries
to guess if you have the right version of Qt, and if so build the miniweb program.

Execute build.sh with the command:

$ sh build.sh


It will try to compile things for you.
At the end it will tell you whether this worked or not.
If it worked, you will have an executable file
called "miniweb". Copy (or move) this file where you
keep your executables.

Installing
----------

It does not matter where you install miniweb, as long as you can find it.
There are two shell scripts called "localinst.sh" and "systeminst.sh"
which will install it. Read those trivial scripts, and adjust them
for your system if needed.
